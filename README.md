# UDP-Server-Client-for-Windows

 UDP Server/Client for Windows, with winsock 2.2.

# Code Information

 The code were created using "Code :: Blocks IDE" and I used "GNU Compiler for C / C ++".                          
 Libraries: <stdio.h>, <string.h>, <winsock2.h>                                                                                      
 This code is tested on Windows 10 Pro(32/64-bit).                                         

# Recommendations
                                                              
 I recommend download the entire projects(Server/Client) for the best performance.
                                                                                                                             
# Server

 This is a UDP server, written in C programming language, that can run on Windows operating systems, 
 with the help of <winsoc2.h> library.
 It can accept more than one parallel communications with Clients, sending messages and receiving data packets from them.
 Server is also updates user(administrator), with messages(Success, Error, etc).                                         
 (You can find more information in comments in the sourse code file "server.c".)
